# Edge Path Optimization Discussion

## Issue Title
[Discussion] Edge path calculation optimizations for dense graphs

## Issue Body

Hey Vue Flow team!

I've been analyzing edge rendering performance in dense graphs and have some observations about path calculations that I'd love to discuss. Vue Flow handles hundreds of edges beautifully, but I'm curious about optimization strategies for extreme cases.

### Current Edge Architecture

From studying the code, I see that:
- Edge paths are recalculated on every transform change
- Bezier/smoothstep calculations happen in `getBezierPath()` and `getSmoothStepPath()`
- Each edge handles its own path computation independently

This is clean and works great for most use cases!

### Potential Optimization Areas

#### 1. Path Memoization
```typescript
// Concept: Cache paths based on start/end positions + curvature
const pathCache = new Map<string, string>()

const getCachedPath = (source: Position, target: Position, options: PathOptions) => {
  const key = `${source.x},${source.y}-${target.x},${target.y}-${options.curvature}`
  if (!pathCache.has(key)) {
    pathCache.set(key, calculatePath(source, target, options))
  }
  return pathCache.get(key)
}
```

#### 2. Batch Path Updates
Instead of individual edge updates, batch similar edges:

```typescript
// Group edges by path type and update together
const updateEdgesByType = (edges: Edge[], transform: Transform) => {
  const bezierEdges = edges.filter(e => e.type === 'bezier')
  const smoothStepEdges = edges.filter(e => e.type === 'smoothstep')
  
  // Batch calculate all bezier paths
  const bezierPaths = calculateBezierPaths(bezierEdges, transform)
  // Apply updates in single batch
}
```

#### 3. Level-of-Detail for Edges
Similar to nodes, edges could have LOD:
- Far zoom: Simple straight lines
- Medium zoom: Basic curves  
- Close zoom: Full bezier with labels

### Questions for Discussion

1. **Have you profiled edge rendering at scale?** I'm curious what bottlenecks you've identified in graphs with 500+ edges.

2. **Path calculation vs DOM updates** - Is the mathematical calculation or the DOM path updates the bigger performance factor?

3. **Static vs dynamic edges** - Would it make sense to optimize differently for edges that rarely change vs edges that update frequently?

### My Testing Context

I'm working with graphs that have:
- 200-800 nodes
- 1000-3000 edges  
- Real-time data flowing through edges
- Need to maintain 60fps during interactions

Current performance is quite good, but I'm exploring optimizations for the most demanding scenarios.

### Benchmark Results

I did some rough testing with path memoization:
- ~15% performance improvement with 1000+ edges
- Diminishing returns with fewer edges (overhead cost)
- Best gains on graphs with repeated connection patterns

### Implementation Ideas

If there's interest, I could explore:

1. **Optional path caching** - Opt-in for performance-critical apps
2. **Path calculation Web Workers** - Offload complex calculations
3. **Simplified path rendering mode** - For extreme density cases
4. **Edge grouping optimizations** - Batch similar edges together

### Questions

- Does this align with Vue Flow's performance goals?
- Are there edge rendering patterns I'm missing that already solve this?
- Would you be interested in performance benchmarking data?

The current implementation is already quite performant - I'm mainly exploring the extremes for specialized use cases. Your architecture makes these optimizations very feasible to add without breaking existing APIs.

Thanks for building such a solid foundation! The edge system's flexibility has been fantastic to work with.
