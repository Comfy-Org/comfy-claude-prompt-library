Forcing re-rasterization at zoom thresholds to prevent pixel stretching?

## Full Discussion Body

I noticed that at extreme zoom levels (>5x or <0.2x), CSS transforms can show pixelation/stretching artifacts since browsers rasterize elements once and then scale that rasterized layer.

Looking at [`Transform.vue`](https://github.com/bcakmakoglu/vue-flow/blob/main/packages/core/src/container/Viewport/Transform.vue#L15):

```typescript
transform: `translate(${viewport.value.x}px,${viewport.value.y}px) scale(${viewport.value.zoom})`
```

Has the team considered forcing a reflow/re-rasterization at certain zoom thresholds? For example, triggering a brief style change that forces the browser to re-rasterize the transform layer:

```typescript
// At zoom threshold crossings (e.g., 2x, 4x, 8x)
if (crossedThreshold) {
  // Force re-rasterization
  element.style.willChange = 'auto'
  element.offsetHeight // Force reflow
  element.style.willChange = 'transform'
}
```

The idea being to get fresh rasterization at the new scale rather than stretching the original. Has this come up before, or do Vue Flow's typical use cases not hit the zoom levels where this becomes noticeable?
