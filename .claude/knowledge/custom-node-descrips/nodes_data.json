LyingSigmaSampler has a great advantage, of course, other nodes are also great. They can be applied to most models, including SD3.5, and they work well, which is a challenge for users because they have to deal with different noise masks. Therefore, I have added smoothing processing to LyingSigmaSampler in the hope of helping more people.",
