## Content Calibration Techniques

### 1. The Grandmother Test
Can you explain the problem to a non-technical person? If not, you might not understand it well enough yourself.

### 2. The Expert Test
Would a senior engineer in this domain learn something new? If not, you might need to go deeper.

### 3. The Practical Test
Can a reader implement something based on your post? If not, you might need more concrete examples.

## Engagement Patterns by Audience

### High Engagement Topics
- Post-mortems with surprising root causes
- Performance optimization with big wins
- Cost reduction success stories
- Novel solutions to common problems
- Tool comparisons with clear winners

### Topics Requiring Careful Framing
- Theoretical or academic concepts (need practical applications)
- Company-specific tools (need general lessons)
- Failed experiments (need clear learnings)
- Opinion pieces (need strong evidence)

## Red Flags That Lose Audiences

1. **Condescending Tone** - "As everyone knows..." or "Obviously..."
2. **Unexplained Jargon** - Using terms without context
3. **Vague Generalizations** - "It's faster" without metrics
4. **Hidden Agenda** - Marketing disguised as technical content
5. **Incomplete Examples** - Code that doesn't actually run
6. **Outdated Information** - Not mentioning version dependencies

## Audience Feedback Signals

### Positive Indicators
- Technical discussions in comments
- Questions about implementation details
- Shares with added context ("Great post about X")
- Follow-up blog posts referencing yours
- Implementation stories from readers

### Warning Signs
- Generic comments ("Great post!")
