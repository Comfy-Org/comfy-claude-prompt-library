## Quick Start

1. Start with [00-overview.md](00-overview.md) to understand the basics
2. Review [02-prompting-techniques.md](02-prompting-techniques.md) for essential techniques
3. Check [09-pattern-consistency.md](09-pattern-consistency.md) before creating new commands
4. Use [06-evaluation-frameworks.md](06-evaluation-frameworks.md) to test and improve your commands

## Key Takeaways

- **Be Direct**: Treat Claude like a brilliant new employee who needs explicit instructions
- **Use Examples**: 3-5 well-crafted examples dramatically improve output quality
- **Structure with XML**: Use tags to organize complex prompts
- **Enable Thinking**: Use trigger words ("think", "think hard", etc.) for complex tasks
- **Evaluate Systematically**: Build test suites to measure and improve performance
- **Maintain Consistency**: Follow established patterns in your command library

## Creating New Commands

When creating a new Claude Code command:

1. Search for similar existing commands first
2. Follow naming conventions and structure patterns
3. Use the templates in [09-pattern-consistency.md](09-pattern-consistency.md)
4. Test thoroughly with diverse inputs
5. Document any new patterns you introduce
