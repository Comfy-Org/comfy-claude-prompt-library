# Node Editor Performance Research Summary

## Executive Summary

Analyzed how modern DAG flow libraries use transforms, SVG, culling, GPU accel, RAF batching, event delegation, LOD, transform containers, etc. to optimize rendering performance. Tldraw seems far better than others, but using with PrimeVue components and Vue 3.5 might be **impossible** because it requires rebuilding everything in their shape system. Vue-flow would be easier but its performance would not be as good (performance is nearly identical to React Flow - both lack many things like culling, LOD, and RAF batching). Implementing this ourselves with canvas for bg and edges and labels and Vue for nodes would be **complex but optimal** - allowing tldraw-level performance optimizations while keeping Vue component compatibility.

## Key Verifications from the Analysis

- Vue Flow and React Flow have nearly identical performance - both use d3-zoom, single viewport transforms, and lack advanced optimizations
- **Tldraw integration would be impossible with existing Vue components** - not just hard
- **A custom hybrid approach (canvas + Vue) would be the only way to get both performance AND component reuse**
