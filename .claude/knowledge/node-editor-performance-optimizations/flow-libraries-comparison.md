## Legend

- ✅ Full support / Feature present
- ❌ Not supported / Feature absent
- N/A Not applicable
- Plugin-dependent: Varies based on which rendering plugin is used

## Key Takeaways

1. **Transform Strategies Vary Significantly**
   - Vue Flow & React Flow: Single viewport transform (simplest)
   - Rete.js: Dual transform system (most flexible)
   - tldraw: Individual shape transforms with matrices (most sophisticated)

2. **Performance Optimizations Are Lacking Across the Board**
   - None use GPU acceleration hints (will-change, translate3d)
   - Only tldraw implements viewport culling and LOD
   - Only tldraw uses requestAnimationFrame batching

3. **Edge Rendering Approaches**
   - Rete.js: Delegates to framework plugins
   - Vue Flow & React Flow: Native SVG paths
   - tldraw: Part of unified shape system

4. **Architecture Philosophy**
   - Rete.js: Maximum flexibility through plugins
   - Vue Flow & React Flow: Framework-specific optimization
   - tldraw: Performance-first with custom everything
