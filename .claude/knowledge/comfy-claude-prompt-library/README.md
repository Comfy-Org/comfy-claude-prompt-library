## Usage

These knowledge files are designed to be consumed by:

1. **Claude Code agents** for understanding repository patterns
2. **Command development** for maintaining consistency
3. **New contributors** for onboarding and context
4. **Meta-commands** for self-improvement and validation

## Quick Reference

- **Command Template**: See `command-architecture.md` for standard structure
