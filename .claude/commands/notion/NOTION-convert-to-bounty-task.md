# Convert Task to Bounty Task

Your task is to convert the following task into a properly structured bounty task following the ComfyUI bounty process: $ARGUMENTS

## Process Overview

Follow these steps to convert a task into a bounty task (make it as a markdown file):

### Step 1: Analyze Task Scope
First, determine if this is a **Task** or **Project**:
- **Task**: A specific feature or improvement (e.g., new feature in frontend, bug fix, enhancement)
- **Project**: A larger scope initiative (e.g., entire new frontend, major system overhaul)

### Step 2: Create Bounty Task Entry

For **Tasks**:
1. **Create the task** under the appropriate project in [Tasks](https://www.notion.so/bf086637f74c4292ae588ab84ff18550?pvs=21):
   - Frontend tasks ‚Üí [ComfyUI_Frontend](https://www.notion.so/ComfyUI_Frontend-5fe8e9b691a14389bc25af1e2fc25982?pvs=21)
   - Desktop tasks ‚Üí [Comfy Desktop Next](https://www.notion.so/Comfy-Desktop-Next-1f96d73d365080d98d86dd109c0221e6?pvs=21)
   - Core/Backend tasks ‚Üí Appropriate backend project
   
2. **Mark as Bounty**: Set the `Tag` field to "Bounty" 
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è **SECURITY WARNING**: This makes the task PUBLIC automatically
   - Do NOT include sensitive details, internal links, or proprietary information
   
3. **Set Bounty Category**: Go to "üí∞ Bounty Task" section and categorize appropriately
4. **[Optional]** Write detailed description in Comfy
5. **[Optional]** Create GitHub Issue and link it in the task

For **Projects**:
1. **Create project** under [Projects](https://www.notion.so/61fcba01de44437c9b041aa4c12b0a5e?pvs=21)
2. **Mark as "Contractor-Needed"**
3. **Write comprehensive project details** in Notion or GitHub Issue

### Step 3: Structure the Bounty Task

Create a well-structured bounty task with these sections:

#### Required Sections:
- **Title**: Clear, concise description of what needs to be done
- **Description**: Detailed explanation of the task requirements
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Specific, measurable outcomes
- **Priority Level**: High/Medium/Low
- **Estimated Effort**: Hours or complexity level
- **Skills Required**: Technical skills needed
- **Resources**: Links to relevant documentation, examples, or codebases

#### Recommended Additional Sections:
- **Background/Context**: Why this task is important
- **Technical Approach**: Suggested implementation strategy
- **Testing Requirements**: How to verify the solution works
- **Deliverables**: What exactly should be submitted

## Best Practices & Tips

### Writing Effective Bounty Tasks:
1. **Be Specific**: Avoid vague requirements like "improve performance"
2. **Include Examples**: Reference existing implementations or similar features
3. **Set Clear Boundaries**: Define what's in scope and what's not
4. **Provide Context**: Explain the business value and user impact
5. **Consider Skill Level**: Match complexity to expected contributor experience

### Common Bounty Categories:
- **Frontend/UI**: User interface improvements, new components, UX enhancements
- **Backend/Core**: API improvements, performance optimizations, new core features  
- **Core Nodes**: Built-in node improvements, new core node types, optimization
- **Documentation**: Guides, tutorials, API documentation, examples
- **Testing**: Unit tests, integration tests, test automation
- **DevOps**: Build improvements, deployment automation, monitoring
- **CLI/Desktop**: Command-line tools and desktop application improvements

### Security Considerations:
- Never include API keys, passwords, or sensitive configuration
- Avoid exposing internal system architecture details
- Don't reference internal-only repositories or resources
- Use placeholder values for sensitive data in examples

### Pricing Guidelines:
- **Simple tasks** (1-4 hours): $50-200
- **Medium tasks** (4-16 hours): $200-800  
- **Complex tasks** (16+ hours): $800+
- **Projects**: Negotiate based on scope
