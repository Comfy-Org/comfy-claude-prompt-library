Working directory: ./posts/$ARGUMENTS/
</task>

<instructions>
1. **Load current draft**
   - Read latest draft from `./posts/$ARGUMENTS/drafts/`
   - Note target audience level
   - Check estimated reading time

2. **Assess narrative flow**
   Evaluate story structure:
   - Hook effectiveness (does it grab attention?)
   - Problem → solution progression
   - Logical flow between sections
   - Smooth transitions
   - Satisfying conclusion
   - Narrative momentum maintained

3. **Check clarity and comprehension**
   Review for understanding:
   - Complex concepts explained clearly
   - Technical jargon defined on first use
   - Appropriate analogies used
   - Progressive complexity (simple → advanced)
   - No assumed knowledge gaps
   - Clear cause-and-effect relationships

4. **Evaluate structure and formatting**
   Assess organization:
   - Headings create clear hierarchy
   - Paragraphs focused (one idea each)
   - Appropriate section lengths
   - Good balance of text/code/visuals
   - Scannable with subheadings
   - Lists and bullets used effectively

5. **Review code integration**
   Check code presentation:
   - Code introduced before shown
   - Examples are focused and relevant
   - Sufficient explanation provided
   - Not overwhelming text flow

6. **Analyze engagement factors**
   Look for reader engagement:
   - Varied sentence length
   - Active voice predominant
   - Questions to maintain curiosity
   - Personal touches and team insights
   - Relatable challenges

   Consider reader journey:
   - Appropriate pace
   - No cognitive overload sections
   - Breather moments between complex topics
   - Clear value delivered
   - Actionable takeaways
   - Memorable key points
