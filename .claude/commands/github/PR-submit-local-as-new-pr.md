# Submit Local Changes as New PR

You are a senior DevOps engineer helping to create a clean, professional pull request from local changes. Your goal is to ensure proper git hygiene, meaningful commit messages, and a well-structured PR submission.

## Context
The user has been working on changes and is ready to submit them as a new pull request. This process requires careful handling of git state, proper branching, and professional PR creation that follows repository conventions.

## Instructions

<workflow>
Follow these steps systematically to create a clean PR:

### 1. Repository State Assessment
First, analyze the current git state:
- Run `git status` to see current changes and branch
- Run `git log --oneline -5` to understand recent commits
- Check if we're on an appropriate feature branch or need to create one

### 2. Branch Management
Handle branching based on current state:

**If on main/master branch OR changes mixed with unrelated work:**
- Identify and stash only the current session's changes with a clear stash message
- Checkout main/master and ensure it's up to date (`git fetch && git pull`)
- Create a new descriptive feature branch following naming conventions
- Apply the stashed changes (`git stash pop`)

**If already on a clean feature branch:**
- Verify the branch name is descriptive and appropriate
- Ensure it's based on the latest main/master
- Ensure this clean branch does not mix seemingly unrelated changes

### 3. Commit Creation
Create a meaningful commit:
- Stage relevant changes carefully (avoid staging unrelated files)
- Write a clear, concise commit message following repository conventions
- Use the format: `[type] brief description` (e.g., `[feat] add user authentication`, `[fix] resolve login timeout issue`)
- Ensure the commit message explains the "why" not just the "what"

### 4. Push and PR Creation
Handle repository type appropriately:

**For public repositories:**
- Push the branch to remote: `git push -u origin <branch-name>`
- Use GitHub CLI to create PR: `gh pr create --title "descriptive title" --body "brief description"`
- Ensure PR title is clear and follows repository conventions
- Write a concise PR description (1-3 sentences maximum) focusing on the value and impact

**For private repositories:**
- Push the branch: `git push -u origin <branch-name>`
- Provide the user with the suggested PR title and description for manual creation

### 5. Cleanup and Restoration
If changes were stashed from another branch:
- Return to the original branch
- Restore any unrelated changes that were stashed
- Verify the original branch state is properly restored

</workflow>

## Validation Steps
Before completing, verify:
- [ ] All intended changes are committed
- [ ] No unintended files are included
- [ ] Commit message is clear and follows conventions
- [ ] Branch name is descriptive
- [ ] PR title and description are concise and meaningful
- [ ] Any stashed unrelated changes are properly restored

## Error Handling
If you encounter issues:
- **Merge conflicts**: Guide through resolution before proceeding
- **Permission errors**: Check repository access and suggest alternative approaches
- **Branch naming conflicts**: Suggest alternative branch names
- **Stash conflicts**: Handle carefully to avoid losing work

## Examples

<commit_message_examples>
Good commit messages:
- `[feat] implement user dashboard with analytics widgets`
- `[fix] resolve memory leak in image processing pipeline`
- `[docs] update API documentation for authentication endpoints`

Poor commit messages:
- `fix stuff`
- `update`
- `changes`
</commit_message_examples>

<pr_description_examples>
Good PR descriptions:
- `Adds real-time collaboration features to the document editor, enabling multiple users to edit simultaneously with conflict resolution.`
- `Fixes critical performance issue in the search algorithm that was causing 3+ second delays for large datasets.`

Poor PR descriptions:
- `Updated some files`
- `Various improvements`
- `Bug fixes and enhancements`
