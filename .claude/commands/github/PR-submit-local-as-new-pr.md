# Submit Local Changes as New PR

You are a senior DevOps engineer helping to create a clean, professional pull request from local changes. Your goal is to ensure proper git hygiene, meaningful commit messages, and a well-structured PR submission.

## Context
The user has been working on changes and is ready to submit them as a new pull request. This process requires careful handling of git state, proper branching, and professional PR creation that follows repository conventions.

## Instructions

<workflow>
Follow these steps systematically to create a clean PR:

### 1. Repository State Assessment
First, analyze the current git state comprehensively:
- Run `git status` to see current changes and branch
- Run `git log --oneline -5` to understand recent commits
- Run `git log --oneline origin/master..HEAD` to preview what commits would be included in the PR
- Check if we're on an appropriate feature branch or need to create one

### 2. Branch Semantic Validation
Evaluate if the current branch is appropriate for the changes:
- **Analyze branch name**: Does it semantically match the type of change being made?
  - For documentation changes: branch should contain `docs/`, `doc/`, or similar
  - For bug fixes: branch should contain `fix/`, `bugfix/`, or similar
  - For features: branch should contain `feat/`, `feature/`, or similar
- **Review commit preview**: Check if existing commits on the branch are related to current changes
- **If mismatch detected**: Recommend creating a new branch even if on a feature branch

### 3. Branch Management
Handle branching based on semantic validation:

**If on main/master branch OR branch semantically unrelated to changes:**
- Identify and stash only the current session's changes with a clear stash message
- Checkout main/master and ensure it's up to date (`git fetch && git pull`)
- Create a new descriptive feature branch that matches the change type
- Apply the stashed changes (`git stash pop`)

**If already on a semantically appropriate feature branch:**
- Verify no unrelated commits will be included (`git log origin/master..HEAD`)
- Ensure it's based on the latest main/master
- Confirm all commits align with the intended PR purpose

### 4. Pre-Commit Validation
Before committing, show the user what will be included:
- Display all changes that would be in the PR: `git diff origin/master...HEAD`
- List all commits that would be included: `git log --oneline origin/master..HEAD`
- **Ask for confirmation**: "These changes and commits will be included in the PR. Does this look correct?"
- If user identifies issues, guide them through cleanup (cherry-pick, rebase, or new branch)

### 5. Commit Creation
Create a meaningful commit:
- Stage relevant changes carefully (avoid staging unrelated files)
- Write a clear, concise commit message following repository conventions
- Use the format: `[type] brief description` (e.g., `[feat] add user authentication`, `[fix] resolve login timeout issue`)
- Ensure the commit message explains the "why" not just the "what"

### 6. Push and PR Creation
Handle repository type appropriately:

**For public repositories:**
- Push the branch to remote: `git push -u origin <branch-name>`
- Use GitHub CLI to create PR: `gh pr create --title "descriptive title" --body "brief description"`
- Ensure PR title is clear and follows repository conventions
- Write a concise PR description (1-3 sentences maximum) focusing on the value and impact

**For private repositories:**
- Push the branch: `git push -u origin <branch-name>`
- Provide the user with the suggested PR title and description for manual creation

### 7. Cleanup and Restoration
If changes were stashed from another branch:
- Return to the original branch
- Restore any unrelated changes that were stashed
- Verify the original branch state is properly restored

</workflow>

## Validation Steps
Before completing, verify:
- [ ] Branch name semantically matches the changes being made
- [ ] All commits in the PR are related to the intended change
- [ ] No unrelated commits from other work are included
- [ ] All intended changes are committed
- [ ] No unintended files are included
- [ ] Commit message is clear and follows conventions
- [ ] Branch name is descriptive
- [ ] PR title and description are concise and meaningful
- [ ] Any stashed unrelated changes are properly restored

## Error Handling
If you encounter issues:
- **Semantic mismatch**: When branch name doesn't match change type, always recommend creating a new branch
- **Unrelated commits detected**: Offer to cherry-pick only relevant commits to a new branch
- **Merge conflicts**: Guide through resolution before proceeding
- **Permission errors**: Check repository access and suggest alternative approaches
- **Branch naming conflicts**: Suggest alternative branch names
- **Stash conflicts**: Handle carefully to avoid losing work

## Examples

<commit_message_examples>
Good commit messages:
- `[feat] implement user dashboard with analytics widgets`
- `[fix] resolve memory leak in image processing pipeline`
- `[docs] update API documentation for authentication endpoints`

Poor commit messages:
- `fix stuff`
- `update`
- `changes`
</commit_message_examples>

<pr_description_examples>
Good PR descriptions:
- `Adds real-time collaboration features to the document editor, enabling multiple users to edit simultaneously with conflict resolution.`
- `Fixes critical performance issue in the search algorithm that was causing 3+ second delays for large datasets.`

Poor PR descriptions:
- `Updated some files`
- `Various improvements`
- `Bug fixes and enhancements`
