1. Use `gh pr list` with appropriate filters to get both open and closed PRs from all repositories you have access to
2. Filter the results to show only PRs created by christian-byrne in the past $ARGUMENTS hours (if not specified, use 26 hours)

   - Repository name
   - Status (open/closed/merged)
   - Creation date/time
   - Direct link to the PR
   - Brief summary of what the PR does (from the description or title)

4. Format the output as:

   - Each PR as a bullet point with all the gathered information
   - Use markdown formatting for better readability
   - Include clickable links

5. If no PRs are found in the time range, clearly state that

Commands to use:
- `gh pr list --author=christian-byrne --state=all --limit=50` (to get both open and closed)
- `gh pr view <PR_NUMBER> --repo <REPO>` to get additional details if needed

Remember to handle cases where:
- No PRs exist in the timeframe
